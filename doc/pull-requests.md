# Development Workflow & Branching Strategy

Each branch in this project is **module/package-specific**.  
- **Module branches** are used for active development (code pushing).
- **Package/main branches** are PR-merged and therefore **protected**.

---

## 🔧 Development Process

1. **Open an issue**
2. **Create package branch(es)** associated with the issue
3. **Create module branch(es)** associated with a package branch
4. **Implement features** on the module branch(es)
5. **Submit a PR** from each finished module to its corresponding package branch
6. **Submit a final PR** to `main` once *all* packages for the issue are complete
   - Merge  
   - Close the issue  
   - Delete unused branches

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

The task breakdown provided by the professor is straightforward, and my approach may introduce additional complexity. However, the goal of this application is to build a **high-standard, well-structured project**.

> **Testing must evolve with the codebase.**  
> Documentation, comments, and planning are integral parts of development and not afterthoughts.

I aim to follow a **client-focused mindset**:  
> *“Deliver everything needed to fulfill a requirement—not just code samples.”*

## 🧱 Quality & Professionalism

Advanced planning and code quality should not be optional perks; they should represent the **baseline** of a professional software engineer - something I aspire to become.

I made a plan, which is subject to change (since I am human being and can't be perfect yet). I also try to write the best code according to the plan.
Is this enough for a project to be considered high quality?  

My professor will review the code, and if necessary (and permitted), fellow developers may assist.
The aim is not perfection but **collaboration**, me being the only active contributor.
